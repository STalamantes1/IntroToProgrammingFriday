# #Whats the difference between INT and FLOAT?
# #INT: Whole numbers (decimal point, 10,5,3,6)
# num1=10 #int value, because there's no decimal 
# #Float: Decimal Numbers (10.0,5.0,3.6,6.6)
# num2=2.25
# word='Cat'

# print(num1,type(num1))
# print(num2,type(num2))
# print(word,type(word))

# #Between these two operators / and //, which gives INT value and which gives float
# #// is floor division and gives INT result
# print(10//3)
# #/ is regular division and gives Float Result 
# print(10/3)


# user_text=input("Type something: ")
# print(user_text)
# print(type(user_text))
#No matter what the input is, the data type of user input is always string


# age_text=input("How old are you now? ") #age_text is a string
# age_number=int(age_text) #This converts our string variable value into an INT variable
# print(age_number,type(age_number))
# print(f"Next year you will be {age_number+1}")

#String is what goes between "", string holds no numeric value. Text data
# word="Python"
# #Indexing is used to select one character
# print(word[0]) #This will index the first character
# print(word[1]) #second character
# print(word[2]) #third character


#Slicing (Substring) is when we want to show a range of character
# word2="Programming"
# print(word2[0:4]) #I want to print the first 4 characters
# #print(variable_Name[Start:END])
# #Start at said number, and stop right before END

# phrase="Hello, World!"
# print(phrase.upper()) #To uppercase everything, use .upper() function
# print(phrase.lower()) #To lowercase everything, use .lower() function 

#List is an ordered collection of values, stored within a variable using []
